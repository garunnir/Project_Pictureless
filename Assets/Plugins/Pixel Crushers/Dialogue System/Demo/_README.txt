Dialogue System for Unity - Demo Scene

To play the demo scene, add DemoScene1 and DemoScene2 
(located in the Scenes subfolder) to your project's
build settings. Then play DemoScene1.


** UNITY 6+ / URP / HDRP: ***
If your project uses URP or HDRP, such as the default
setting for Unity 6+ projects (URP), please import the
corresponding unitypackage from the URP_HDRP_Materials
folder before playing the scenes.

** INPUT SYSTEM PACKAGE: **
If your project uses the Input System, see the steps
in the subfolder Scenes/New Input System.

Note: If you're using the evaluation version, it's 
precompiled with support for the legacy Input Manager 
for compatibility with users on older Unity versions. 
Once you update to the full Asset Store version, you'll 
be able to enable Input System support.
